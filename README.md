# FamUP - An app that is yet to do something
___

This is supposed to be my major project for college to complete my degree in Computer Science. I am planning to build a mobile application that will help families to manage their daily tasks and events. The app will have a calendar, a to-do list, a shopping list, and a chat feature. The app will be built using React Native and Firebase. (<<=Copilot wrote this lol)

## Pending installations
